### How to Build With Script:

Simply just run ``` ./build.sh ``` in the root folder, the script will do the rest for you. 
(at the end will ask if you want to run the game, if something went wrong, please enter "n")

### How to Build Manually:

in your terminal, from the root of the project, run

```bash
cmake .
```

and then

```bash
make
```

### How to Run:

* If on windows, you can just run the "game.exe" file inside the <b>build</b> directory.
* If on linux, run ```./build/game``` from the directory you built in.

### Controls:

For now, the controls are not customizable.
* A or LEFT ARROW / W or RIGHT ARROW - runs left / right
* SPACE / W / UP ARROW - jumps
